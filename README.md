# DirectX 12-Sphere
This is a real-time render of a sphere I made in C++ using DirectX 12. The render uses a mixture of technical animations, procedural noise functions, a compute shader and PBR (Physically based rendering) techniques to achieve the output. Further technical and mathematical explanations are provided in the PDF(s). Make sure to download and link against the DirectX graphics samples, the SDL2-devel library and glm. Simple tutorial document is included. Feel free to download and use this code and project however you want, no credit needed. It's completely open-source!
