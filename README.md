# DirectX12-Sphere
This is a real-time render of a sphere I made in C++ using DirectX 12. The render uses a mixture of technical animations, procedural noise functions, compute shaders and PBR (Physically based rendering) to achieve the output. Further technical and mathematical explanations are provided  in the PDF-files.
