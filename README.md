# DirectX 12-Sphere
This is a real-time render of a sphere I made in C++ using DirectX 12. The render uses a mixture of technical animations, procedural noise functions, a compute shader and PBR (Physically based rendering) techniques to achieve the output. Further technical and mathematical explanations are provided  in the PDF-files. Make sure to download and link against the DirectX graphics samples and the SDL2-devel library. Simple tutorial document is included.
